== Frequently Asked Questions ==
If you've got any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

= I made a update from a previous version. What now? =

* If you're using on your website shortcode from this plugin, the best way is to delete old code and generate it again.
* If you're using widget, you must update its options.
* **Go to the plugin settings page and see if there are any notifications**


= How can I add custom theme? =

1. Now, you can add your custom stylesheet in your's theme directory.
2. If you don't have "css" folder in your WordPress theme, you must create it.
3. Then, in this folder create another - named "wp-posts-carousel" and now you can move custom stylesheets in there :)

Folders tree should looks like this: 
`/themes/my_wordpress_theme/css/wp-posts-carousel/custom.css`
